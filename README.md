Search Instagram for photos taken at a [given place and time](http://www.propublica.org/nerds/item/a-super-simple-tool-to-search-instagram-by-time-and-location).

## Quick Start

0. `bundle install`

1. Register for a new [Instagram client application](http://instagram.com/developer/clients/register/) and set your OAuth redirect_uri to `http://localhost:4567/`.

2. Get a [Google Maps API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial#api_key).

3. Create a `keys.yml` file in the root of the app, and set it like so:

```
instagram_client_id: YOUR_KEY
instagram_secret: YOUR_KEY
google_client_id: YOUR_KEY
google_key: YOUR_KEY
```

2. Run using `ruby app.rb` or however you like running Sinatra apps.
